### Introduction

Humans are highly social, our survival depends on cooperation and socialization with others of our kind. As a result, the quality of our social relationships plays a huge role in our well being. People who are reportedly happier have more, and  stronger interpersonal relationships, and spend less time alone. Other studies show that extraversion has a strong correlation with happiness, this is due to their higher propensity for engaging in social interactions.  It comes as a surprise then that although we are social, with a need to interact and build relationships, our interactions with strangers is surprisingly minimal. 

Researchers in the field of psychology have observed that compared to the amount of people we come across within public spaces, interactions between strangers are relatively scarce. This is even more surprising when we take into account research which proposes that speaking to strangers provides a positive social effect for both parties of the conversation. Other researchers have found that speaking to strangers is also correlated with an increased feeling of belonging. So this prompts the question as to why people are not interacting more with strangers, and what can we do as a community to reap the benefits that come with this social interaction. Interviews from these investigations point towards a pessimistic view of how these conversations will turn out as the principal culprit for people's hesitation to interact with strangers. People are generally inclined to believe that others are not interested in what they have to say. 

Other researchers point towards a lack of confidence in conversational skills, and not knowing the benefits that social interaction provides for the other party. This problem is likely to be exasperated by the current COVID-19 pandemic, as researchers have shown that perceived social isolation is becoming more prevalent across all age groups, and is tied to poor life satisfaction. As this problem progresses, current trends in technology push us towards the virtual world. It is imperative to take action towards promoting social engagement, and helping people reap the benefits of exercising their conversation skills with strangers.


### Problem Statement

Social isolation is a growing issue that impacts quality of life, mental health and mortality. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought with it unprecedented levels of social isolation, which are likely to linger over the long term. There is a need to actively promote social behaviors, and minimize the obstacles that people face when engaging in social interactions, as a means to combat social isolation.

Our target domain is social interaction. We wish to provide a way for people who wish to increase the frequency of their social interactions, engage in social activities, and improve the quality of their social skills. As a result, this should lead to increased life satisfaction, happiness, and confidence in social, and conversation skills. The target client for our solution would be any person which desires to produce these outcomes from social interaction with strangers.

The solution we propose is centered around building a system that allows users to find other nearby people who desire to engage in social interactions in person, thus eliminating one of the primary obstacles that prevent people from talking to strangers, the belief that others are not interested in social engagement. The same system should allow users to provide structured feedback on the quality of their conversations, giving users a chance to reflect on the effects of their social interactions on others, research shows that this effect is on average more positive than people predict. The exposure to this positive feedback is likely to increase the likelihood of the user engaging in further conversation with strangers. Negative feedback could be used to identify areas that might need work in the user's social skills, providing a starting point for improvement. Furthermore, the compilation of this feedback can be used to measure the user's progress in developing their social skills, and the ability to create, and track quantifiable goals towards fighting social isolation, and creating positive habits and behaviors. 


### Project Objectives

The major objective of this project is to build a system which allows users to find other users and engage in social interaction in person, and receive feedback that they can use to improve the quality of their future interactions. 

- Develop a system that allows users to find strangers that are physically nearby so that they may engage in in-person conversation.
- Allow users to create and join sub-spaces in which they can find people nearby who share a common interest or purpose.
- Create an interface for allowing users to provide and see feedback on their social meetings engaged in through the application.
- Integrate user feedback with goal setting features, so that users can work towards improving the quality of their social interactions.

The system will be evaluated by users, an 80% overwhelmingly positive rating will be considered successful. The system's correctness and reliability will be evaluated using automated testing with 100 % code coverage of the system features.
