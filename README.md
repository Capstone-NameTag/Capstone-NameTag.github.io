### Project Objectives

The major objective of this project is to build a system which allows users to find other users and engage in social interaction in person, and receive feedback that they can use to improve the quality of their future interactions. 

- Develop a system that allows users to find strangers that are physically nearby so that they may engage in in-person conversation.
- Allow users to create and join sub-spaces in which they can find people nearby who share a common interest or purpose.
- Create an interface for allowing users to provide and see feedback on their social meetings engaged in through the application.
- Integrate user feedback with goal setting features, so that users can work towards improving the quality of their social interactions.

The system will be evaluated by users, an 80% overwhelmingly positive rating will be considered successful. The system's correctness and reliability will be evaluated using automated testing with 100 % code coverage of the system features.
